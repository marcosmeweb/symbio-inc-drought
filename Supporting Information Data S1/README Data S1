The Supporting Information Data S1 includes the files of the phylogenetic trees (in RDS format, which can be open in R) and data frames (in csv format) with plant mycorrhizal strategy and drought adaptation assignments according to dataset v1 to v6. These dataset versions were assembled as described in the materials and methods section of Cosme (preprint at bioRxiv).
