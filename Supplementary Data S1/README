The Supplementary Data S1 includes the files of the phylogenetic trees (in RDS format, which can be open in R) and data frames (in csv format) with mycorrhizal strategy and drought adaptation assignments for plant species according to dataset v1 to v6. These dataset versions were assembled as described in the materials and methods section of Cosme (submitted).
