# symbio-inc-drought
This is the data and code repository of the project "mycorrhizal strategy and drought adaptation evolution in plants" of the SYMBIO-INC research program (European Commission's grant H2020-MSCA-IF-2018 SYMBIO-INC GA838525). Here, I provide the Supporting Information Data S1, Data S2, and Data S3 as well as the Supporting Information Note S1 with codes used to run the hidden Markov models on dataset v1 to v6. The dataset v1 to v6 were assembled as described in the materials and methods section of Cosme (submitted). The Supporting Information Data S1 provides the files of the phylogenetic trees and data frames of the dataset v1 to v6. The Supporting Information Data S2 provides the global georeferenced occurrences of plant species included in the assembled dataset versions, determined as described in the materials and methods section of Cosme (submitted). The Supporting Information Data S3 provides the output files of the corHMM function organized based on the dataset version analyzed. The Supporting Information Note S1 is a R script file with the default codes employed to generate the files of Supporting Information Data S3 using the files of Supporting Information Data S1. All files can be downloaded and open in R.
