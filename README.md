# symbio-inc-drought
This is the data and code repository of the project "plant mycorrhizal strategy and drought adaptation evolution" of the SYMBIO-INC research program (European Commission's grant H2020-MSCA-IF-2018 SYMBIO-INC - GA 838525). Here, I provide the Supplementary Data S1, Supplementary Data S2, and Supplementary Data S3 as well as the R script with the default codes used to run the hidden Markov models of incrementing complexity on dataset v1 to v6, using the corHMM function of the R package corHMM v2.1. The dataset v1 to v6 were assembled as described in the materials and methods section of Cosme (submitted). The Supplementary Data S1 provides the files of the phylogenetic trees and data frames of the dataset v1 to v6. The Supplementary Data S2 provides the global georeferenced occurrences of the plant species included in the assembled dataset versions, determined as described in the materials and methods section of Cosme (submitted). The Supplementary Data S3 provides the 810 output files of the corHMM function organized first based on dataset version analyzed, and second based on whether the models are of dependent or independent evolution of mycorrhizal strategy and drought adaptation. All files can be downloaded in the release section and can be open in RStudio.
