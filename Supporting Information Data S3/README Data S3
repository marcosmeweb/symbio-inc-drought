The Supporting Information Data S3 provides the output files of the corHMM function resulting from the analysis of Cosme (posted at BioRxiv). These files are deposited inside folders based on the dataset version analyzed, and the folders are named ‘Model output files based on dataset v1’ to ‘Model output files based on dataset v6’. Inside each folder, the output files are named according to their respective models as follow: ‘mode of evolution’ (+ ‘plant character’ in the case of independent evolution) + ‘model structure’ + ‘number of hidden rate categories’ + ‘_’ + ‘number of the replicated start’. For example, ‘depARD1_1.RDS’ is the output file of the model with dependent (dep) mode of evolution, ARD model structure (see Methods section of Cosme for details), hidden rates with a sigle (1) category, and is the replicated start number 1. In another example, the ‘indepMycSYM3_4.RDS’ is the output file of the model with independent (indep) mode of evolution for the character ‘mycorrhizal strategy’ (Myc), SYM model structure, hidden rates with three (3) categories, and is the replicated start number 4. In another example, ‘indepDroER2_3.RDS’ is the output files of the model with independent mode of evolution for the character ‘adaptation to drought’ (Dro), ER model structure, hidden rates with two (2) categories, and is the replicated start number 3. All output files are saved in RDS format and can be downloaded and open in R with the pre-loaded corHMM package.
