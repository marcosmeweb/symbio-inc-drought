The Supplementary Data S3 provides the output files of the corHMM function resulting from the analysis of Cosme (submitted). These files are deposited inside folders with two levels of organization. The first level is based on the dataset version analyzed, and the folders are named ‘Model output files based on Dataset v1’ to ‘Model output files based on Dataset v6’. The second level is based on whether the models are of dependent or independent evolution of mycorrhizal strategy and drought adaptation, and folders are named "Model output files - dependent evolution between characters", "Model output files - independent evolution of drought adaptation", and "Model output files - independent evolution of mycorrhizal strategy". Inside each of these three folders, the output files are named according to their respective models as follow: ‘mode of evolution’ (+ ‘plant character’ in the case of independent evolution) + ‘model structure’ + ‘number of hidden rate categories’ + ‘_’ + ‘number of the replicated start’. For example, ‘depARD1_1.RDS’ is the output file of the model with dependent mode of evolution, ARD model structure (see materials and methods section of Cosme for details), hidden rates with one category, and is the replicated start number 1. In another example, the ‘indepMycSYM3_4.RDS’ is the output file of the model with independent mode of evolution for the character ‘mycorrhizal strategy’ (Myc), SYM model structure, hidden rates with three categories, and is the replicated start number 4. In another example, ‘indepDroER2_3.RDS’ is the output files of the model with independent mode of evolution for the character ‘adaptation to drought’ (Dro), ER model structure, hidden rates with two categories, and is the replicated start number 3. All output files are saved in RDS format and can be downloaded and open in R with the corHMM package pre-loaded.
